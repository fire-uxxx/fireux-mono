# Authentication Timing Fix

## Problem Solved

When using `useAppUser()` in layout components, there was a timing issue where:
- Layout renders before user authentication completes
- Navigation menus show incomplete route lists
- Private routes (like "Employer Profile", "Professional Profile") missing from mobile navigation

## Root Cause

The `useAppUser()` composable is asynchronous - it fetches user data from Firestore after Firebase auth completes. Without proper awaiting, layouts render with `null` user data initially, then reactively update when data loads.

## Solution

Use `await useAppUser()` in layout script setup and reference the direct value (not `.value`):

### ❌ Before (Problematic)
```vue
<script setup>
const { appUser } = useAppUser()
const jobPrivateRoutes = appUser.value ? getPrivateJobRoutes() || [] : []
// Layout renders immediately with appUser.value = null
// Private routes missing until reactive update
</script>
```

### ✅ After (Fixed)
```vue
<script setup>
const { appUser } = await useAppUser()
const jobPrivateRoutes = appUser ? getPrivateJobRoutes() || [] : []
// Layout waits for user data before rendering
// All routes available immediately
</script>
```

## Key Differences

1. **`await useAppUser()`** - Blocks layout rendering until user data loads
2. **`appUser` not `appUser.value`** - After await, get direct value not ref
3. **Synchronous route calculation** - All routes computed with complete data

## Applied To

- ✅ `/Users/danielwatson/Dev/fireux/projects/misebox/misebox-app/app/layouts/default.vue`
- ✅ `/Users/danielwatson/Dev/fireux/projects/misebox/misebox-app/app/layouts/dashboard.vue`
- ✅ All other layout files in cleanbox and other apps

## Result

- Mobile navigation shows complete route list immediately
- No missing private routes for authenticated users
- Consistent behavior across all layouts
- Clean, simple code without complex reactive watchers
