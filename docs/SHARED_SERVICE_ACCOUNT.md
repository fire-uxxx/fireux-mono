# Shared Service Account Configuration ✅

## Overview

Firebase service accounts are now shared between tenant apps that use the same Firebase project, eliminating duplication and simplifying management.

## Implementation

### ✅ **Shared Location**

```
packages/tenants/fireux-misebox/config/service-account.json
```

### ✅ **Apps Using Shared Service Account**

- **MiseBox App** - Chef marketplace
- **Niederhorn** - Restaurant application

Both apps share the same Firebase project (`misebox-78f9c`) and therefore use the same service account.

### ✅ **Updated .env Configuration**

```properties
# Shared service account path (from app root)
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=../../../packages/tenants/fireux-misebox/config/service-account.json
```

### ✅ **Benefits**

1. **🎯 Single Source of Truth** - One service account file for all misebox tenants
2. **🔄 Easy Updates** - Update service account in one place for all apps
3. **📦 Reduced Duplication** - No more copying service accounts between apps
4. **🛡️ Consistent Security** - All apps use identical Firebase credentials
5. **🧹 Cleaner Structure** - Service accounts live with their respective tenant modules

### ✅ **Pattern for Other Domains**

```
packages/tenants/fireux-cleanbox/config/service-account.json  # For cleanbox apps
packages/tenants/fireux-jobs/config/service-account.json     # For job apps (if needed)
```

### ✅ **Validation Results**

- **MiseBox App**: ✅ Running successfully with shared service account
- **Niederhorn**: ✅ Running successfully with shared service account
- **Firebase Auth**: ✅ No authentication errors

This pattern should be applied to all tenant modules going forward for consistent, maintainable Firebase configuration.
